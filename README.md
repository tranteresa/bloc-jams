# Bloc Jams

## What is Bloc Jams?

Bloc Jams is a web application that allow users to play music on a web browser or mobile device. It features an interactive scroll bar, volume controls, and play/pause buttons. 

This application was built as a part of Bloc's Frontend Foundations Curriculum. 


## Problem
The goal of Bloc Jams was to build a functioning music player from scratch to apply knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Git, and Github. 



## Solution
Prior to my enrollment in Bloc, I was only familiar with HTML and CSS. The Bloc curriculum provided guidiance and resources to reinforced concepts in a project setting. 

I used Git and Github content management systems to track updates and changes. Bloc Jams consists of three page types and several features. I built and tested each feature before commiting changes and pushing them to the master branch. 

HTML and CSS were used to create the structure and style of the web app, while JavaScript was used for the interactive functionality. jQuery was used to refractor portions of the code.
